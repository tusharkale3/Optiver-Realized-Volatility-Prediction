# Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction

Cutting-edge code for precise market volatility forecasts. Leverage advanced models and strategies for optimized risk management.
This repository contains code for predicting realized volatility in financial markets using various machine learning algorithms including KNN Regressor, Elastic Net Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), XGBoost Regressor, and Random Forest with a stacking ensemble approach.

## Overview

Realized volatility prediction is a crucial task in financial markets for risk management, trading strategy development, and portfolio optimization. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to predict realized volatility, which is a measure of the variation in price of a financial instrument over time.

## Algorithm Overview

We implement the following algorithms in our prediction pipeline:

- KNN Regressor
- Elastic Net Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- XGBoost Regressor
- Random Forest (used in stacking ensemble)

## File Description

- `volatility_prediction.py`: Contains the entire codebase including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and stacking ensemble implementation.

## Usage
